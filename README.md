# Self-Supervised Deep Learning- Based Speech Denoising

This project presents a self supervised deep neural network solution to speech
denoising by reducing the complexity of the requirement for training data, that is,
clean speech signals are necessary for network training. This solution implements
speech denoising by obtaining clean speech signals from noisy signals. The
approach is based on training a Fully Convolutional Neural Network to map a
noisy speech signal to another noisy version of the speech signal.
